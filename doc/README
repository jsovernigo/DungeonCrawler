Pledge of Honesty
******************
    By handing in this assignment with this README file, I
assert that I have sole access and control over my submission,
and that this submission contains entirely my own work. I
affirm that I have not colaborated in the creation of this code,
nor have I taken any segment of code that I do not have express
ownership or permission to use.

************
Compilation
************
1- cd to the root of the folder of the program.
2- either use:
    a) gcc -Wall -std=c99 -o run ./src/main.c ./src/driver.c ./src/entities.c ./roomgen.c -I./include -lncurses
    OR
    b) type 'make' in the root folder.
3- to remove resources generated by compilation, please type 'make clean'

********************
Running the program
********************
1- run './run <levelFile>',
    where <levelFile> is a path to the text description of the level
2- use w, a, s, d, to move around.  Use 'q' to quit, any other action causes your player
    to stumble and requires you to move again. (yes, this WASTES YOUR TURN.  Be precise.)
3- walking into an enemy damages them. Beware, as they can attack you if they are faster!

********
Testing
********
Test:   Program was tested with an empty level file.
Result: Program reported a failed run, and exited gracefully.

Test:   Program was tested with a normal level file.
Result: Program reported a successful run, game executed normally

Test:   Program was tested with an abnormally formatted level file
Result: Program reported a failed run, and exited gracefully.

Test:   Program was tested with a normal level file (for collision detection)
Result: Program reported a successful run, and game ran smoothly.  Collisions
        worked as expected.

Test:   Program was tested with invalid file paths (generally)
Result: Program reported errors with input files.

Test:   Program was run under normal conditions, and various non-legal actions were attempted:
        action: attempting to leave the room through doors
        result: player cannot advance
        
        action: attempting to leave from hallway
        result: player cannot advance
    
        action: invalid keys are pressed
        result: player loses his turn.

        action: player attempts to stand on an enemy
        result: combat event triggered; player cannot advance.


************
Limitations
************

1) Due to the nature of c strings, file lines cannot exceed 256 bytes.
2) Due to a limited space on the map, rooms cannot exceed 20x25.
3) If insufficient room data is present, the game will not launch, and
   will simply report an error.
4) Due to a lack of error checking, items that are 'one per level' will
   be added multiple times if the input file specifies it.
